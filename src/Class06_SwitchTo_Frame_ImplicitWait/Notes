    Definition: Frames allow developers to divide a web page into multiple,
     independent sections, each with its own document and window object.

    Usage:

    Frames are typically used when a web page needs to display multiple views,
     each with its own content, without requiring the entire page to reload.
     Web developers can use the HTML <iframe> element to create a frame within a web page.

    3 ways to interact with frames:



    Switching back from a frame:
    To switch back from a frame to the main page, you can use the following code:
        driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

    Topic: Implicit and Explicit Wait

    Definition:

    Implicit Wait: The Implicit Wait is a setting that applies to the findElement()
     method of the WebDriver object. It tells the WebDriver to wait for a
     certain amount of time before throwing an exception if the element is not found.

    Explicit Wait: The Explicit Wait is a way to tell the WebDriver to wait for a certain
    condition before throwing an exception. It works with the ExpectedConditions class
    and waits until certain conditions are met or the given time is achieved.

    Usage:

    Implicit Wait: Use the Implicit Wait when you want to set a default wait time for all elements.

    Explicit Wait: Use the Explicit Wait when you want to wait for a specific
     condition to be true before proceeding. It is especially useful when waiting for elements that load asynchronously.

    Example:
    Implcit:
    driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);


    Explicit:

    Using ExpectedConditions class with Explicit Wait:

    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
    WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("myElementId")));
